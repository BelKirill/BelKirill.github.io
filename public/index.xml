      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-you-should-sign-up-for-a-free-for-life-oracle-cloud-instance&#34;&gt;Why You Should Sign Up for a FREE FOR LIFE Oracle Cloud Instance&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building hobby projects with AI pair programming (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) is exhilarating—but without a solid operations layer, your code can become fragile, unmaintainable, and vulnerable to “hallucinations.” Enter &lt;strong&gt;Oracle Cloud Always Free Tier&lt;/strong&gt;: a truly free-for-life cloud sandbox that gives you industrial-strength DevOps capabilities at zero cost. Below, we’ll explore why it’s worth your time, plus a few caveats to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I’m &lt;strong&gt;Gil Blinov&lt;/strong&gt;, a Senior DevOps Engineer based in Israel. I started in the tech world in 2002 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a DevOps engineer from 2016. I help design, build and operate scalable, reliable infrastructure on AWS and GCP. At Fairgen, I’m the solo DevOps lead, owning everything from infrastructure, through CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Skaffold) to observability (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki) and security automation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond work, I’m a lifelong tinkerer:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I’m Writing a Series of Articles Directed at Home Coders: Industrial Strength DevOps at Home and for Free</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a passionate hobby coder, I’ve always been driven by curiosity—exploring new languages, frameworks, and approaches. With AI-powered pair programming tools like Copilot and friends, the excitement of seeing your ideas come to life has never been easier. But there’s a catch: turning those hobby projects into something resilient, maintainable, and production-grade requires more than just fancy code generation. It requires an operations mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-am-i-writing-a-series-of-articles-directed-at-home-coders&#34;&gt;Why am I writing a series of articles directed at home coders?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see a gap between what home coders often do and what’s needed to elevate those projects to the next level. Professional projects don’t just live and die by their codebase—they’re supported by a robust operations layer: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, security best practices, and monitoring. That’s where the real magic happens, and where hobby coders often get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
