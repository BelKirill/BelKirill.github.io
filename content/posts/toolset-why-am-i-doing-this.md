## Introduction
As a passionate hobby coder, I’ve always been driven by curiosity—exploring new languages, frameworks, and approaches. With AI-powered pair programming tools like Copilot and friends, the excitement of seeing your ideas come to life has never been easier. But there’s a catch: turning those hobby projects into something resilient, maintainable, and production-grade requires more than just fancy code generation. It requires an operations mindset.

## Why am I writing a series of articles directed at home coders?
I see a gap between what home coders often do and what’s needed to elevate those projects to the next level. Professional projects don’t just live and die by their codebase—they’re supported by a robust operations layer: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, security best practices, and monitoring. That’s where the real magic happens, and where hobby coders often get left behind.

## Abstract 
When you’re pair programming with AI, one of the main differentiators between hobby projects and professional projects is the operations layer surrounding them. Sure, you can generate code at lightning speed. But without a safety net—like automated testing, reproducible builds, and continuous delivery—your project can quickly turn into a maintenance nightmare.

This is why I’m writing this series: to invite you, the home coder, to step up and join me in bringing industrial-strength DevOps practices into our hobby projects—without breaking the bank.

We’ll explore:
-	CI/CD tools in the Go ecosystem, tailored to work hand-in-glove with Copilot-powered workflows
-	Ways to bulletproof your home projects against AI hallucinations and coding mishaps
-	Approaches to make your side projects as shippable and reliable as those in the workplace
-	Tools and practices that are free—no credit card required—yet powerful enough to keep your home lab as tight as any corporate setup

I’m convinced that with the right mindset and tools, we can bring the same level of polish and reliability that enterprise systems enjoy into our own personal projects.

Let’s turn our homes into labs of innovation, with AI at our side—and industrial-strength DevOps to back it all up.

Stay tuned!
