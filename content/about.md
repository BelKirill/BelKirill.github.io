Hello! I’m **Gil Blinov**, a Senior DevOps Engineer based in Israel. I started in the tech world in 2002 and I've been working as a DevOps engineer from 2016. I help design, build and operate scalable, reliable infrastructure on AWS and GCP. At Fairgen, I’m the solo DevOps lead, owning everything from infrastructure, through CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Skaffold) to observability (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki) and security automation.

Beyond work, I’m a lifelong tinkerer:

- **Current Personal Projects**  
  - A Hugo-powered blog exploring DevOps best practices, AI-aided workflows and integrations.  
  - An experimental MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to learn about OpenWebUI and OpenAPI.

- **Interests & Hobbies**  
  - Tabletop world-building, especially RPGs with mythic and cyberpunk twists.  
  - Board and card games, we play as a family ;)
  - Audio books. From fiction to professional material.

I’m also a proud husband to Liat—an independent food-safety consultant—and father of two (ages 11 and 7). When I’m not automating infra or drafting blog posts, you’ll find me exploring new tech, gaming with friends, or chasing after my kids.
